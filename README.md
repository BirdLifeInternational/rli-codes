Codes and instructions for running the Red List Index calculations

This repository includes the scripts to calculate the Red List Index for mammals, birds, amphibians, corals and cycads (and the combination of these), and documentation for these codes. This includes a script to calculate the species-country overlap (to work out the proportion of each species' range in each country) and then the codes to calculate the Red List Index using this information. There are also addition scripts to help filter to the species of interest (if are only running the species-country overlap analyses for a subset of species).
